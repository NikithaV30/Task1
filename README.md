**Data cleaning and pre-processing**

  To clean and prepare a raw dataset by handling:

  Loading Sales Dataset which is in csv format

  Find Missing values by isnull() 

  Removing Duplicates by drop.duplicates()

  Correct Inconsistent formats and Incorrect data types

  Format column names with no spaces

  The cleaned dataset is now ready for deeper analysis or visualization in tools like Power BI or matplotlib/seaborn.
